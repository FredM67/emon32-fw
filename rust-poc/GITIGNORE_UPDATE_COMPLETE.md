# .gitignore Update Summary

## Changes Made

Updated `.gitignore` to reflect the new organized project structure after build script consolidation and binary cleanup.

### New Ignore Patterns Added

#### Archive Directories
```ignore
# Archive directories for old build artifacts
bin/archive/
bin/old_builds/
build_scripts_archive/
```

#### Backup Files
```ignore
# Backup files from cleanup operations
*.backup
README.md.backup
```

#### qfplib Build Artifacts
```ignore
# qfplib build artifacts
qfplib-sys/target/
*.o
*.a
*.so
*.lib
```

#### Temporary Build Files
```ignore
# Temporary build files
*.tmp
*.temp
build_output.txt
compile_commands.json
```

### Verification

Current ignored files (from `git status --ignored`):
- ✅ All binary artifacts in `bin/` directory (`.elf`, `.uf2` files)
- ✅ Archive directories (`bin/archive/`, `bin/old_builds/`, `build_scripts_archive/`)
- ✅ Backup files (`README.md.backup`)
- ✅ Build artifacts (`target/`, `Cargo.lock`)
- ✅ qfplib-sys crate build directory

### Benefits

1. **Clean Repository**: Binary artifacts and temporary files are properly ignored
2. **Archive Protection**: Old builds and scripts are safely archived but not tracked
3. **Build Artifact Management**: All generated files are properly excluded
4. **Backup Safety**: Cleanup operation backups are ignored but preserved locally
5. **Cross-platform**: Covers various OS and editor temporary files

### Structure Alignment

The updated `.gitignore` aligns with:
- Unified build system (`build_unified.sh`)
- Organized binary structure (`bin/` with archives)
- qfplib-sys crate integration
- Build script consolidation (archived scripts ignored)
- Cleanup operation artifacts
