5. **Code Size**: Rust can produce very compact binaries with proper optimization

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

- Build system and toolchain setup
- Memory layout and safety

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- HAL compatibility with specific peripherals
- Interrupt timing and real-time constraints
- DMA integration complexity

### High Risk ⚠️
- Complete feature parity timeline
- Performance matching in interrupt handlers
- Third-party peripheral library availability

## Conclusion

The Rust proof-of-concept demonstrates successful migration feasibility. The core energy calculation algorithms work correctly, memory usage is optimal, and the foundation is solid for expanding to full hardware integration. The next phase should focus on ADC and UART implementation to create a minimal working firmware that can be deployed and tested on hardware.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 2 (Hardware Integration) starting with ADC sampling and UART output.
