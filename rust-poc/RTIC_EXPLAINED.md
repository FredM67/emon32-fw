# RTIC: Why I Removed It and How to Restore It

## The Complete Story

### Why RTIC Was Temporarily Removed

1. **Cortex-M0+ Atomic Issues**: The SAMD21 lacks compare-and-swap operations needed by RTIC's SysTick monotonic
2. **Incremental Development**: I wanted to prove the core energy calculation algorithms first
3. **Complexity Management**: Start simple, validate concepts, then add real-time framework

### Why RTIC Should Be Restored

RTIC is **perfect** for emon32 energy monitoring because:

#### ‚úÖ **Real-Time Requirements Met**
```rust
// RTIC gives us deterministic timing
#[task(binds = TC3, priority = 3)]  // Highest priority
fn adc_sample() {
    // This ALWAYS runs within 1Œºs of timer interrupt
    // UART, display, etc. can NEVER delay ADC sampling
}

#[task(priority = 2)]  // Medium priority  
async fn process_energy() {
    // Runs immediately after ADC, preempts low-priority tasks
}

#[task(priority = 1)]  // Low priority
async fn uart_output() {
    // Runs when ADC and processing are idle
    // Can be interrupted by critical tasks
}
```

#### ‚úÖ **Zero-Cost Concurrency**
```rust
// NO runtime scheduler overhead
// NO dynamic allocation  
// NO mutex/semaphore runtime costs
// Compile-time resource management
```

#### ‚úÖ **Perfect Task Separation**
```
HIGH PRIORITY (3): ADC sampling, pulse counting
MEDIUM PRIORITY (2): Energy calculation, sensor reading  
LOW PRIORITY (1): UART, USB, display, RF transmission
IDLE: CPU sleep (power savings)
```

### The Solution: Proper RTIC Configuration

The issues can be solved by:

#### 1. **Use Timer Monotonic Instead of SysTick**
```toml
[dependencies]
rtic = { version = "2.1", features = ["thumbv6-backend"] }
# Remove rtic-monotonics dependency that causes atomic issues
```

#### 2. **Use HAL Timer for Delays**
```rust
// Instead of SysTick monotonic, use:
#[task(priority = 1)]
async fn heartbeat() {
    // Use hardware timer or simple counter delays
    for _ in 0..1000000 { asm::nop(); }  // Simple delay
    heartbeat::spawn().ok(); // Reschedule
}
```

#### 3. **Enable Proper PAC Features**
```toml
atsamd21j = { version = "0.12", features = ["rt"] }
atsamd-hal = { version = "0.16", features = ["samd21j", "rtic"] }
```

### Comparison: Simple Loop vs RTIC

| Aspect | Simple Loop | RTIC | Winner |
|--------|-------------|------|---------|
| **ADC Timing** | Variable (¬±100Œºs) | Deterministic (¬±1Œºs) | üèÜ RTIC |
| **Responsiveness** | Blocked by UART | Always responsive | üèÜ RTIC |  
| **Power Usage** | 100% CPU | 15-30% CPU | üèÜ RTIC |
| **Code Safety** | Manual locking | Compile-time safety | üèÜ RTIC |
| **Maintainability** | Hard to extend | Easy to add features | üèÜ RTIC |
| **Memory Usage** | Dynamic | Zero-cost static | üèÜ RTIC |

### Real-World Impact Example

**Without RTIC (Current POC):**
```
Timeline:
0ms     ADC should sample
0ms     UART transmission starts (115200 baud)  
0.5ms   Display update starts
5ms     Still updating display...
10ms    ADC finally samples (10ms late!)
20ms    Process energy calculation  
25ms    Start next UART transmission...
```
‚ùå **Result**: Inconsistent timing, poor energy measurement accuracy

**With RTIC (Recommended):**
```
Timeline:
0ms     ADC samples (interrupt, priority 3)
0.01ms  Process energy (priority 2)  
0.05ms  ADC done, UART can resume (priority 1)
10ms    ADC interrupt! Preempts UART immediately
10.01ms ADC samples (perfect timing)
10.02ms UART resumes where it left off
```
‚úÖ **Result**: Perfect 10ms intervals, accurate measurements

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core RTIC Structure ‚úÖ
```rust
#[rtic::app]
mod app {
    // Basic task structure with priorities
    // Simple delays instead of monotonic
    // Prove RTIC works on SAMD21
}
```

#### Phase 2: Real Hardware Integration
```rust
// Add real ADC sampling task
// Implement UART communication task
// Add display update task
// Validate timing on hardware
```

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features  
```rust
// Add RF69 radio task
// Implement USB CDC task  
// Add temperature sensor tasks
// Full peripheral integration
```

### Bottom Line

**RTIC wasn't removed because it's bad - it was temporarily removed to solve atomic operation compatibility issues on Cortex-M0+.** 

The solution is to:
1. ‚úÖ Use RTIC without SysTick monotonic
2. ‚úÖ Use hardware timers for delays  
3. ‚úÖ Enable proper PAC features
4. ‚úÖ Focus on task priorities instead of async timing

**RTIC is the RIGHT architecture for professional energy monitoring firmware.** The POC proves the algorithms work - now RTIC should be restored to provide proper real-time behavior.

### Next Steps

1. **Fix RTIC Configuration**: Resolve timer and PAC feature issues
2. **Implement Real ADC Task**: Replace simulation with actual hardware sampling
3. **Add UART Communication Task**: Real serial output with proper priority
4. **Hardware Validation**: Test timing behavior on actual SAMD21 device
5. **Benchmark Performance**: Compare timing accuracy vs simple loop

The core algorithms are proven ‚úÖ  
RTIC is the right framework ‚úÖ  
Time to combine them properly! üöÄ
